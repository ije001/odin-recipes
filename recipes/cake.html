    <h3>Vanilla Cake</h3>
    <p>This is my best vanilla cake recipe. A classic butter cake but with Japanese techniques applied for the most plush, soft and moist yellow cake like you have never had before. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Plain flour</li>
        <li>Eggs </li>
        <LI>Baking powder</LI>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Vailla extract</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>  Beat the eggs with sugar for a whole 7 minutes until thick and glossy, it changes from yellow to white, and tripled in volume (just over double depth in the bowl).</li>
    <li>Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt. Then add into egg mixture in 3 lots, mixing for just 5 seconds on Speed 1 in between. This should make the flour just incorporated .</li>
    <li> use a microwave or stove to heat milk with the butter until it melts. Believe it or not, HOT milk helps with aeration in this cake..</li>
     <li>Mix some batter into hot milk – this serves two purposes: a bring down the temperature of the hot milk so it wont “cook” the eggs (ie. tempering); and b it lightens up the density of the hot milk </li>
</ol>
